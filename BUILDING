the tool chosen to build the package is CMAKE

<somewhere>


clone/download the current sources
from .... ( to be filled later )
into the <source>  directory

create a binary directory ( where the build will take place )
<binary>

for ease of use <source> an <binary> should be at the same level

also to save some typing the cmake setup assumes
that the <binary> will have the format xxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyy

where xxxxxxxx will be the last part of the install prefix
and yyyyyyyy will be the build type Release/Debug for now

for this setup just
cd <binary>
cmake ../<source>
make/nmake

for a different naming convention or layout

cd <binary>
cmake <full source path> -DINSTALL_PREFIX=<the install prefix>  -DBUILD_TYPE=<the build type>
